# Title   
Homework_1 Refactor

## Description

* I have added proper indentation in the HTML file.

* One of the links in the HTML file was not correctly linked with an id. I have connected the link with the proper id and made sure it is now working.

* The title was improperly named, I have renamed it to a short, concise, descriptive title.

* I have renamed the HTML tags using semantic elements. The document has now semantic, descriptive tags.

* I have added descriptive `alt` attributes to every image and tested to make sure everything works.

* CSS selectors were rearranged to match the flow of the HTML file.

* CSS selector were grouped to match the DRY (Don`t Repeat Yourself) principle.

* Each unique CSS definition was explained using comments.

* Repository was named `homework_1`.

* Added README file that contains all the changes made to the HTML and CSS files, link to the Github repository, link to deployed application and screenshot of the working application.
